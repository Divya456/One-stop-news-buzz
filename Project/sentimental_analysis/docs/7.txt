Pakistan sentences Kulbhushan Jadhav to death, India terms proceedings 'farcical'
A Pakistani military court Monday sentenced former Indian naval officer Kulbhushan Jadhab to death after being found guilty of "spying".  Jadhav, 46, was purportedly arrested on March 3 last year by Pakistan security officials in Balochistan after he entered from Iran. He has been charged with espionage and "waging war" against Pakistan. Accusing him of working for India’s Reasearch & Analysis Wing, Pakistan’s Field General Court Martial (FGCM) awarded him death sentence under the Pakistan Army Act. "On Monday Chief of Army Staff Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa confirmed his death sentence awarded by FGCM. Jadhav was "tried by FGCM under section 59 of Pakistan Army Act (PAA) 1952 and Section 3 of official Secret Act of 1923," Pakistan’s Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said.
In a statement, ISPR added, "Jadhav was an Indian intelligence official who aided and financed terrorist activities in the southwestern Baluchistan province and the southern port city of Karachi. Jadhav confessed before a magistrate and court that he was tasked by Indian spy agency Research and Analysis wing to plan, coordinate and organise espionage and sabotage activities seeking to destabilise and wage war against Pakistan through impeding the efforts of law enforcement agencies for the restoration of peace in Balochistan and Karachi."
